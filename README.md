## 📖 Topics Covered
 - 💡 Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.
 - 🔢 Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking.
 - 🎓 OOP Concepts: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction.
 - 🤔 LeetCode Problems: Solutions to frequently asked coding interview problems.
 - 📋 Question Patterns

## Here’s a glimpse of the question patterns I’ve worked on:

## 1️⃣ Arrays
 - 🔍 Search in Rotated Sorted Array
   
    _Problem: Search for a target element in a rotated sorted array._
   
    _Solution: Binary Search for O(log n) time complexity._
## 2️⃣ Linked List
- 🔗 Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
  
     _Problem: Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list._
  
     _Solution: Use two pointers for optimal merging._
## 3️⃣ Recursion and Backtracking
- 📐 Permutations of an Array
  
     _Problem: Generate all permutations of an array of integers._
  
     _Solution: Recursive backtracking with base and recursive cases._
## 4️⃣ Trees
 - 🌳 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
   
      _Problem: Return the level order traversal of a binary tree._
   
      _Solution: Use BFS and a queue._
   
# 🎯 Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
## 🛠️ Class and Object
- 📝 Student Management System
  
   _Implemented Features: Add, remove, and view student records._
## 🏠 Inheritance
- 🏢 Employee Management System
  
    _Implemented Features: Hierarchical structure using inheritance (Manager, Engineer)._
## 🚀 Polymorphism
- 📊 Shapes Area Calculator

  _Implemented Features: Overriding calculateArea() for different shapes like Circle and Rectangle._
